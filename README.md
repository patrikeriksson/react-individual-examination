# React - Individual Examination

A SPA (Single-page application) school project created using React. It uses githubs API to showcase my projects and has a simple contact form to make it easy for users to contact me. (Contact form is not actually functional yet.)

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
